# Unit 03: Looping Structure: for and while

### Objectives:
- Get familiar with image classification in machine learning, and the Haar algorithm for detecting stop signs

- Master creating lists in Python

- Learn how to run the same block of code multiple times

- Develop object-avoidance algorithms using while loops to keep scanning for and respond to pedestrians and stop signs
