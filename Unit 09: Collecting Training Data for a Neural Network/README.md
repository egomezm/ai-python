# Unit 09: Collecting Training Data for a Neural Network

### Objectives:
Gain an intuitive understanding of the Neural Network learning algorithm.

- Build a track for your car to drive on.

- Collect data by driving your car on your track; the data will be used later to train a Neural Network to self-drive the car!
